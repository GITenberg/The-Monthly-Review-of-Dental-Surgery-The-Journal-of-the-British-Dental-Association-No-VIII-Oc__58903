<p class='c006'>The subjects rightly embraced in a Medical education,
and the degree and manner in which those subjects should
be respectively studied, have been freely discussed in
many places during the last few weeks. Dr. Michael
Foster in an “Address in Physiology,”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of unsurpassed
interest, contends without contradiction that no medical
subject—now that the entrance upon medical studies is
preceded by a tested preliminary education—need be
studied as heretofore as a mere mental training, and
proposes that topographical anatomy, which has hitherto
been so studied, should, to a certain extent, give way in
favour of a more complete knowledge of physiology. The
address must, and no doubt will, be read by all interested
in medical education, whether general or special.  The
following quotation will answer our present purpose:—</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Address in Physiology, delivered at the Annual Meeting of the
British Medical Association, 1880.—Published in <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>,
August 21st, 1880.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I think I am not overstating the case when I say that, in the two
years (or less than two years) which the medical student devotes to
studies other than clinical, 60 or 70 per cent. of his time—in some
cases even more—is spent on the study of topographical anatomy. That
study may be regarded in two lights—as a discipline, and as practical
useful knowledge. The late Dr. Parkes, in a remarkable introductory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>address which he delivered at University College, London, many years
ago, insisted most strongly that its value as a discipline was far higher
and more precious than its direct utility; and I imagine that the more
one reflects on the matter, the more clearly this will appear. The
details of topographical anatomy have this peculiar feature, that, though
they can only be learnt with infinite pains and labour, unlike other
things hard to learn, they vanish and flee away with the greatest ease.
I would confidently appeal to my audience of practical men, how much
of the huge mass of minute facts, which in their youth they gathered
with so much toil, remained fresh in their minds two years after they
passed the portals of the College; and how much now remains to them
beyond a general view of the parts of the human frame, and a somewhat
more special knowledge of particular regions, their acquaintance with
which has been maintained by more or less frequent operations. I would
confidently ask them what is the ratio, in terms of money or any other
value, which the time spent in those early anatomical struggles—say
over the details of the forearm—bears to the amount of that knowledge
remaining after twenty, or ten, or even five years of active practice, or
to the actual use to which that knowledge has been put.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it is as a discipline, and not for its practical utility, that anatomy
has been so useful; and this, indeed, may frequently be recognised in
the questions set at examinations. When the candidate is expected to
describe, within the error of a few <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">millimètres</span></i>, the structures traversed
by a bayonet thrust obliquely through the neck, or is invited to reproduce
written photographs no less exact of the parts which, from skin to
skin, underlie a triangle or quadrangle drawn in ink on the front or back
of the thigh, it is clear that the examiner has in view, not the needs of
practical life, but an easy means of testing the proficiency of the student
in mnemonic gymnastics. Of the value of anatomy as a discipline, there
can be no doubt. In past years, it has served as the chief culture of
the medical student—as the chief means by which the rough material
coming up to our great medical schools were trained to habits of
accuracy, of exactness, of patient careful observation; and their
memories strengthened by exercise for the subsequent strain which
would have to be put upon them by more strictly professional learning.
In this aspect, the very sterility of the subject was a virtue. The
mere fact that the separate details seemed to hang loosely, isolated in
mental space, held together by no theory, by no ideas, inasmuch as it
made the learning a harder task, increased its disciplinary value. Most
wisely did the leaders of our profession insist that no trouble or
expense should be spared to afford the neophyte this preparatory
scientific training; and that, as far as examinations and the like can go,
no pains should be spared to compel him to avail himself of the opportunities
offered. Indeed, viewed as a branch of education, the machinery
of anatomical instruction has for many years past not been equalled
by any.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>Professor Burdon-Sanderson in his introductory lecture,
says,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The precious years which immediately precede a man’s entry on
professional duty, are far too valuable to be wasted in learning anything
he does not intend to retain.”—<cite>British Medical Journal</cite>, October 9th,
1880.</p>

<p class='c011'>The observations of these most distinguishing physiologists
and teachers, support the view which has been taken
respecting the education of the Dental Surgeon, from the
time the College of Surgeons was in 1857 asked to establish
a Dental department, up to the determination of the Dental
curriculum by the Medical Council in 1879.</p>

<p class='c008'>An education equal in degree, but different in kind to
that of the General Surgeon—an education which embraces
a knowledge of the general principles of Medicine and
Surgery, and a special, precise, and practical knowledge
of Dental Surgery, was asked and given, the degree of
education progressing as the attendant circumstances
allowed, up to its present advanced condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The place assigned by Dr. Michael Foster to topographical
Anatomy in Medical education, will certainly
hold good in the education of the Dental Surgeon. Physiology
and Chemistry, subjects now inseparable and of
surpassing interest, are equally necessary to the Special
and General Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The position of Medicine and Surgery is not quite
parallel. The general principles of each must be
thoroughly known, but it is not necessary that the Dental
Surgeon should be practically acquainted with all the
details that pertain to any other branch of either than that
which he selects to practice. It is not needful that he
should become a skilful midwife or oculist, or that he should
be skilled in the treatment in any other class of diseases
than those to the treatment of which he proposes to devote
his life. For if he does acquire such detailed knowledge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>it will, when no longer used, “fade like a raindrop upon a
porous stone,” and the time devoted to the acquisition will
have been wasted, and, perhaps, worse even than wasted,
for the subject may have been studied at the cost of neglect
of the practical study of his speciality. It does not admit
of doubt that the high degree of manual skill, without
which the professed dentist is but a shameless pretender,
can be acquired best, perhaps can be fully acquired only
during youth; that if the acquisition be put off till a medical
education is completed, the golden opportunity will have
been lost. Mr. Fawcett tells us that the blind may acquire
manual skill sufficient to secure independence, but that it
can be gained only during youth. The adult blind, he says,
have a greatly diminished power of learning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time may come when the principles of Medicine
and Surgery will be taught before their special application
to any particular class of disease, and their modification
resulting therefrom is entered upon. Till that time arrive,
it will be in the interest of the Dental Surgeon to study
with the utmost care the general principles and their
application to his own speciality, and to acquire, while he
can, a very full and perfect knowledge, practical, as well
as scientific, of Dental Surgery, before he enters upon a
detailed study of their application to any other branch or
subject of Medicine or Surgery, the practice of which he
does not propose to follow, and a trustworthy knowledge
of which can not be retained or extended in the absence of
continuous general practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The qualified surgeon who has devoted himself to the
practice of dentistry, may be legally qualified to treat any
and every kind of case, but would he be morally right in
undertaking the treatment of a case, say of fever or of
stone? all his knowledge of which diseases lies in a misty
memory of facts brought before his notice, and studied for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>a pass examination in long past student days. As a
matter of fact, the dental surgeon of necessity limits his
practice to his speciality, and the general surgeon as a
further fact, where selection is possible, declines to take
Dental cases, though legally entitled so to do. In the
absence of special training, he cannot be expected to
possess the special knowledge requisite to successful treatment,
and to add the Dental to the over loaded Medical
curriculum, would be to greatly increase the rejections
which, in the case of the College of Surgeons, have already
risen to the formidable amount of upwards of thirty per
cent. of the candidates for diplomas. Hence it is that Dr.
Michael Foster, in asking for more physiology, asks for less
topographical anatomy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dental curriculum requires for its honest fulfilment,
the whole of the assigned four years, and more must not
be attempted in the same four years, for to repeat the
words of Professor Burdon-Sanderson,—“The precious
years which immediately precede a man’s entry on professional
duty, are far too valuable to be wasted in learning
anything he does not intend to retain,” to which may be
added, or which his subsequent occupation will not allow
him to retain. If then more medical knowledge is required
of the student than is embraced in the dental curriculum,
more time must be given for its acquisition.</p>

<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>(<i>Continued from page 425.</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the period when transplantation was systematically
performed, the operators kept themselves supplied with
an assortment of dried teeth, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, sound teeth, obtained
generally from the dead subject, to make use of in case the
tooth to be transplanted should not prove adaptable to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>new abode. The process is not spoken favourably of, as
the results were mostly unsatisfactory, but at times such
teeth became perfectly firm, and even resisted the greatest
efforts at their removal. We can hardly for one moment
suppose that teeth in the condition these were could have
ever become attached to a living alveolo-dental membrane,
and the difficulty of accounting for this firmness would
have been great indeed, had it not been already solved for
us. In Langenbeck’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv. für Chirurgie</span>, vol. iv., is a
paper on “The Replantation and Transplantation of Teeth,”
by Dr. A. Mitscherlich, which deserves to be better known,
and which, apparently, cannot have come under the
observation of those who recently contributed to the <cite>Lancet</cite>
on the subject, the excuse for which is less, since it has
been translated into English.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The author, in addition to
much interesting and original matter, records the following
experiment. In the upper jaw of a dog of a year old, Dr.
Mitscherlich inserted into the socket of an incisor he had
removed, a similar tooth taken from a dog’s skull, and
which he retained in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">situ</span></i> by means of a silver wire passed
through a hole in the tooth, and a hole bored through the
alveolar process of the jaw. “After six weeks the
dog was killed, having been given during the last few
days three grains of picronitrate of potash three times a
day; the carotids were immediately injected. The
muscles, like the gums, were coloured yellow: neither,
however, in the implanted tooth nor in the sound ones was
any alteration of colour perceptible. The silver wire was
porous, and no longer held the tooth; it was removed.
The tooth was quite firmly seated, and could not be moved
in the least by the fingers. The gums, as in the remaining
teeth, were accurately applied both to the alveolar process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>and also to the tooth itself, and nowhere could any alteration
be found in it. The tooth was sawn through lengthways,
together with the upper jaw, with a fine saw, so that
the pulp cavity was laid bare in its whole extent. The
latter was only filled with a little detritus, and no trace of
the pulp was discoverable; none of the injection, too, had
been forced into the cavity. The tooth was everywhere
most intimately connected with the surrounding parts, and
suppuration showed itself nowhere. Of the periosteum, on
the other hand, there were only in a few places some small
remains discoverable. On the posterior surface of the
tooth two small cavities were visible; the larger of which
lay more towards the point of the fang, and extended to
the pulp cavity; they were filled with a soft substance,
and their walls appeared roundish. These appearances were
entirely confirmed by microscopical examination, inasmuch
as only in a few places, especially on the anterior surface of
the tooth, were traces of the periosteum to be demonstrated;
where this was absent the tooth was eaten away,
and its absorption had proceeded in such a manner, that a
multitude of globular elements appeared on the section,
resembling the fragments which we find in ivory pegs
which have been bored into bones, and retained in them
a considerable time; in the two above-mentioned cavities
the absorption had proceeded farther and farther, and had
at last attained its above-mentioned great extent. The
cementum could still be demonstrated in certain places, it
was, however, absorbed in the greatest part of its extent.
In the cavities of the tooth substance, masses of bone were
embedded, they were applied to the walls of the cavities
without any kind of intermediate substance, and so held
the tooth with such extraordinary firmness. This osseous
deposit, which was directly connected with the alveolar
processes, was freely traversed with blood vessels, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>sometimes extended themselves close up to the tooth substance.
It was also so fully developed, that the process
had to be looked upon as fully accomplished, and therefore,
a later exfoliation of the tooth was not to be expected.
The dentine itself showed nothing abnormal.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. “Archives of Dentistry,” Edited by Edwin Truman, vol. i., p. 169.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We have quoted the author of the foregoing at some
length, as some of his conclusions upon this interesting experiment
might seem antagonistic to our own. Thus,
whilst we agree with him in concluding that a dead tooth
becomes united to a living jaw by a certain amount of
absorption of its fangs by osteoblasts, and a subsequent
calcification of such tissue, we do not believe such process
as fully accomplished or permanent. The valuable researches
of Tomes and De Morgan show that during life a
continual process of formation and absorption is taking
place in bone, whilst the former has also pointed out that
the process of absorption in the fangs of temporary teeth
is one alternating between absorption and deposition,
though in the end in favour of the former, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, that the
osteoblasts which effect the absorption of the dentine often
become calcified, but are again eventually decalcified and
become active osteoclasts. What determines these bodies
to act, so to speak, in a positive or a negative capacity
would be most interesting to discover, and, in considering
the subject, we can hardly overlook the views of Mr.
Bridgman, who compares the process of bone formation
and decalcification to what occurs in an electrolytic cell,
where, by changing the direction of the current, the electrodes
assume precisely opposite functions.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, then, we could discover the conditions that would
preserve the bone tissue, in connection with the dentine,
from undergoing decalcification, we might, with every prospect
of success, transplant dead teeth, but which, as at
present carried out, invariably, we believe, eventually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>suffer the fate of ivory pegs introduced into the extremities
of bones in disunited fractures. Indeed, this result,
although more slowly effected, appears nearly always to
follow in those cases where the transplanted or replanted
tooth has lost much of its alveolo-dental membrane;
whether the excising of a portion of the fang, as advocated
by Magitôt, will prove beneficial or otherwise, remains to
be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Porcelain teeth having indentations in their fangs have
been suggested, first, we believe, by Mitscherlich,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and
again by a recent writer in the <cite>Lancet</cite>. The former actually
attempted two cases, and with the success we should have
anticipated, for when after four or five weeks the caoutchouc
splint which retained them in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">situ</span></i> was removed they immediately
followed the splint and fell out. “Ossification had
not taken place; the entirely heterogeneous mass of stone
had acted as a foreign body, produced granulation and
suppuration, and so prevented union.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In conclusion, we think enough has been stated to show
that transplantation or replantation of living teeth, or at all
events, of teeth having living alveolo-dental membrane
may be exceptionally carried out with benefit to the
patient; if the chances of permanent success be not very
great the chances of injury are, we believe, small, and
have been greatly exaggerated. No such case has come
under our observation, but then in all we have witnessed, the
transplanted or replanted tooth has never been ligatured
or otherwise forcibly retained in its alveolus. We believe
many of the cases of failure, as probably those also of bone
exfoliation, arose from this procedure. A tooth, after either
operation, although at the time perfectly adjusted to its
proper position, becomes, after a day or two, elongated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>from its socket and less firm; the result of effusion into
the alveolo-dental membrane and about the tooth; as this
material becomes organized it forms, no doubt, the medium
of union between the dental and alveolar portions of that
membrane. At all events, after a week or so the tooth
again recedes into its socket, and as it does so becomes
firmer and less sensitive to pressure; if our view be correct,
the employment of a ligature or forcible retention of the
tooth can only be objectionable. A very different matter,
however, will be the adjustment of a plate contrived so as
to protect the transplanted or replanted tooth from violence
or pressure until its attachment is ensured.</p>

<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By M. G. CUNNINGHAM.</span></div>

<p class='c014'>After twenty-five years of stubborn fight supporters of gold as a
filling for decayed teeth accept the possibility of plastic material
being in certain cases its superior; throughout this period I have
been content to hold my peace and act entirely on my own
judgment in the selection of material, as however, it seems to be
the fact that a man who uses plastic filling without danger of being
termed a “quack,” may speak, I would, through your kind agency,
convey to brother Dentists my method of preparing metallic
amalgams, which has saved me much trouble and my patients a
large number of teeth.</p>

<p class='c010'>In using amalgam, the first thing we ought to take into consideration
is whether that which we are using and calling by that
name is such, and I venture to say that in a very large number of
cases it is no amalgam at all, but a concrete admixture of solid
metals with liquid mercury. In the early days, when metallic
precipitate of silver was employed, perfect amalgamation was not
difficult to obtain, provided the precipitate had been in the first
instance properly washed and carefully stoppered, the minute
sub-division of the metal and absence of oxidation aiding largely
to this result. The fillings of the present day are of a totally
different character, coarse in grain, and of a nature to oxidize on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>even momentary contact with air, they become difficult to amalgamate
with mercury, which, in itself, is a highly oxidizable metal,
so that recourse is often had to a glass tube and violent agitation
to produce that which is at best only a semblance of what it should
be—a thoroughly homogeneous mass, that upon setting will retain
a uniform texture and density proportionate to the constituents
of which the fillings are composed. If, however, to the fillings
and mercury be added a drop or less of sulphuric acid, either in
the palm of the hand or mortar, it will be found that the metals
will almost instantaneously amalgamate, whilst the oxides combining
with the acid leave a residuum which, by its quantity,
clearly shows what a very imperfect body could have been a so-called
amalgam containing only a small portion of them. Washing
in pure water at once removes all trace of acid, and a thoroughly
reliable stopping can be at once produced from materials otherwise
worse than useless.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>Introductory Lecture to Course on Dental Mechanics.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By Dr. J. WALKER.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,—The authorities of the Dental Hospital of
London have entrusted to me the heavy responsibility of
lecturing on Dental Mechanics for this present Session of
1880 and 1881. I have undertaken this post with many
misgivings; the subject is so wide and comprehensive, the
study so important to you now, and the effect of good or
bad teaching will so deeply affect your whole life, that I
might well have hesitated before finally accepting the
duties that will now devolve upon me.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have taken a great interest in this Hospital and School
from its early foundation, when the pupils were few, and
the School and Hospital had, so to speak, to win its spurs;
but in passing, I may here remark that that small class of
students, then a new feature in London life, by their diligence,
learning and conduct, have established throughout
the country a name and reputation that you will have
to perpetuate. It was by the combined efforts of the
whole profession, and by the fact that its senior members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>were able to point back to so many successful students of
this School and Hospital, now earnest practitioners in
nearly every large town of the British Isles, that the
leaders of our department of Surgery were enabled to
bring this special branch before the notice of Parliament,
and obtain a Bill which now governs the method and
extent of the classes and hospital practice of all our schools.</p>

<p class='c008'>As your lecturer, I may perhaps without egotism mention
that I was one of the six gentlemen appointed as the first
Assistant Dental Surgeons to this Hospital, while it was
struggling through its first year of active life. I remained
at my post nearly ten years, until driven by increasing
practice to relinquish the work, then, as now, carried on
in your Hospital. It is the knowledge and experience I
then gained, and the lessons I have since learnt as the
result of treatment in private practice, that I have now to
offer you—many failures and some successes, many abortive
schemes, and some inventions that have stood the test
of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>My best thanks are due to the Managing Committee of
this Hospital, for electing me to be the colleague of such
men as Alfred Coleman, C. S. Tomes, and D. Lewis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gentlemen, I am fully conscious of the honour, and will
do my best, if health and strength are given me, to redeem
in part the loss you have sustained in the resignation of
your late teacher, Mr. James Smith Turner. I know that
you and your companions in hospital practice held him in
high esteem. He has been a true friend to the London
Dental School. He had become a ripe and experienced
teacher, one fully alive to the best manner of treating his
subject, passing by what the student might gain for himself
from books, to dwell upon those details that a man of his
experience could so fully grasp. But much as we miss
him, we may yet congratulate ourselves that we have not
to mourn over the death of so good and faithful a friend.
He is now as actively at work in another sphere of Dental
life; he is even working harder than ever in perfecting the
work that has so prospered in the hands of Messrs. Tomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>and Turner. He is consolidating the Dental Act of 1878,
making every effort to render the Register of 1881 as
perfect as may be, and to raise the standard of Dental
Education throughout Great Britain. That the number
of Dental Schools may be equal to what is now demanded
by students, the schools be sound in teaching power, the
men elected as teachers be conscientious in their newly
appointed work, that full and complete courses on each
Dental subject be delivered—these are a few items of his
daily work. The end and object of his endeavours is that
the students in the various schools may gather wider stores
of knowledge during their curriculum, so that the various
examining bodies may see their way to enforce a higher
standard of examination than is now enforced to obtain
the L.D.S. Diploma, and the coveted power of registration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those gentlemen who were members of Mr. Turner’s
class last year will join with me in wishing him long life
and energy to complete his self-imposed task.</p>

<p class='c008'>To come to the special subject of my lecture. At the
risk of provoking the well-known retort of “nothing like
leather,” I venture to assert that no man can ever prove
himself a good Dental Surgeon unless he is a skilled artist in
Dental Mechanics. To kindle a spark of my own enthusiasm
for the subject, to fan that spark into a flame that shall
burn brighter and brighter in your life until you lay down
the file and the engraver, with a sense that you have done
some good work in the world, is at once my endeavour and
my duty. A painter or sculptor of eminence in his profession
is frequently the leader in the fashionable world,
he is feasted by the city guilds, his company is sought by
the rich and noble, he has the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i> to the literary circles
of every capital, yet the work of the artist is, at best, but
to reproduce a faint imitation of nature in cold marble or
on inanimate canvass. The subjects of your handiwork
will be full of life and animation.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is the necessary training for such accomplishments?
A full and perfect realization of all the forms of human
beauty, and of woman’s beauty in particular. Why do I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>dwell so much on the complete form of beauty? Because
no face can be perfect in beauty, unless its features each
and all are in harmony. The teeth have a peculiarly marked
position in relation to the features: one missing link in the
circle will attract attention and mar the harmony of an
otherwise lovely face, like a false chord in music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Projecting, discoloured, irregular, misshapen, crowded
teeth, all tend to destroy symmetry. If so in the natural
course of dentition, how much more in the artificial!</p>

<p class='c008'>I would urge you all to undertake at starting a thorough
study of the normal bones of the skull.</p>

<p class='c008'>Normal bones of the face.—In the anatomical class at
your general hospital you will study the bones of the face
in considerable detail, but there your attention will be
directed to the common or general characters of the bones.
You will there have to learn the usual shape of the bones,
their processes, ridges, grooves and depressions; you will
be shewn the characters, not only by which you may at
once recognise them, but which you may always recognise
in them. I cannot too strongly urge you to master all
these details.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, Gentlemen, here we have to study these bones in a
practical manner; we have to look upon them as parts of
the living countenances of our patients, and as no two
faces are exactly alike, a study of individual faces is
necessary, as a groundwork for your success in practical
mechanical dentistry, and you must study individual
specimens of each of the facial bones. A careless observer
of a crowd of negroes might think they were all alike, because
each had a black skin, woolly hair, retreating foreheads,
thick lips and white teeth. But yet a close observation
would quickly tell him in truth there came behind
all these coarse resemblances, minute, but noteworthy
differences, differences which he would be compelled to
take note of before intercourse with them would be possible.
In the same way a general anatomist merely points
out to you how all palates are alike, and I want to go
farther and shew you with equal truth how no two are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>alike, but all differ. Depend upon it, gentlemen, your
usefulness and success will vary with your skill in perceiving
these lesser differences which characterise individuals.
The best name I can give to this study is
comparative human anatomy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us take some examples of what I mean. The upper
jaw bone is the most complex of all the bones of the face.
Looking at its central part or body we are first of all
struck with the cavity in it—the antrum of Highmore.
Now, if you take a hundred bones, you will not be able to
find two antra exactly alike, but they will differ in size, in
shape, in depth, in width, and in size of their angles and
inclination of each of their walls. And all these peculiarities
influence the countenance, and must, therefore, be
studied before you can hope to be successful in replacing
the lost dental organs. The high cheek bone of the
Scotchman is a very familiar example of the effect of a
variation in the antrum.</p>

<p class='c008'>The alveolar process.—The natural setting of the teeth
varies also in its depth, thickness, smoothness, irregularity,
and most importantly in its curve, which may be a broad,
open semi-circle, or a narrow semi-ellipse. The nasal process,
too, varies as much in different specimens; you will
find differences in length, breadth, in the angle it forms
with the body of the bone, and with the frontal bones; all
these particulars modify the shape of the nose, and as I
shall have to point out to you, no feature is more worthy
of your careful study than the human nose in its numberless
varieties. The malar process of this bone has similar
varieties. Notice again the palate plate how it differs in
breadth and arch, and so modifies importantly the roof
of the mouth, to which a denture has been adapted.
The malar bones are unlike in thickness, the size of their
angles, length of their offspringing processes, and in the
exact mode of articulation with neighbouring bones. See
too, how frontal bones vary, in one case a broad, bold line
forehead, in another overhanging, in a third narrow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>pointed, and you meet with infinite varieties between
these extremes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In passing to the nasal bones, not only must we notice
how they differ in length and breadth, and the level of
their edges, but that the shape of their arch is constantly
varying; it may be broad and rounded, or narrow and
high, even to sharpness. This depends upon the prominence
forward of the bony nasal septum, the interval
between the nasal processes of the upper maxilla, that is
to be bridged over the breadth of the nasal bones, and
the exact mode of their articulation with the upper jaw
bone. Not alone does the usual arch differ thus, but most
obviously on the angle it forms with the frontal lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>From your own observation you will at once grant
me that noses vary as much as families; in fact I am
inclined to think that there is a good deal to be said
for Mr. Shandy’s philosophy of noses. The cartilages
of the nose play a most important part in the shape of the
organ, and demand your study as much as the bones. Each
variation in the shape of the nose has a corresponding
variety of upper lip, and the correlations between these
two must be most carefully attended to. Granted that
these differences are so numerous, you must admit that
the nose must have primary importance in the estimate of
the Dental Surgeon, when called upon to restore the lost
Dental organs. I may remark that although I am examining
noses every day of my life, I have never yet found one
assuming a direct line with the other central lines of the
head and face.</p>

<p class='c008'>To arrive at a just appreciation of the effect of these
bones on the lines of the face you must examine them in
the articulated skeleton, not in one instance but in many—fifty
or even a hundred—make weekly visits to the Museum
of the Royal College of Surgeons, and there examine all
the specimens of articulated skulls and skeletons, until you
fully grasp the meaning of comparative human anatomy—the
size, the shape, the relative acuteness of angles, the
proportions of the different parts. It is this relationship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>the articulation of each bone with the other bones of the
skull that is of primary importance to the Dental Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last bone that I shall mention to you this evening
is the lower jaw, perhaps the most important of all. You
will all soon be taught that it has a body, a symphysis, a
ramus with its condyle, coronoid process and sigmoid
notch, an alveolar process, and various tubercles, ridges,
spines, grooves, and depressions. But beyond all such
facts, be at pains to notice, gentlemen, how all these
various parts differ in different specimens. The changes
in the angle of the bone that are met with at different
ages are notorious, but you will have to learn that the
angle of every adult differs, that each form of countenance
has its special maxillary angle, nor are the depth, thickness,
curve, obliquity and relative prominence of different
parts of the bone one whit more constant, and if you
would succeed in fitting artificial dentures to a lower jaw,
these individual peculiarities of the bone must be carefully
studied.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dental organs will be presented in full detail by my
colleague, Mr. C. S. Tomes, but I should fail in the one
point of my brief sketch, if I did not refer you to the fact
that no circle is found exactly corresponding with a second
in the articulation of the thirty-two teeth implanted in the
maxillary bones. My remarks culminate in this apparently
strange contradiction, no two sets of teeth ever describe
the same circle at any age. The differences in children are
only slight, yet a difference exists; the older the subject, the
greater the contrast visible. Yet harmony exists in the
lines of the face; once acknowledge this and you will perceive
the labour and investigation necessary to make you
grasp the subject in its broadest sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take, for instance, a patient at the age of sixty, with
edentulous jaws, requesting artificial dentures to be prepared
at your hands. For such mechanism to be successful
in the restoration of the contour of the face, it will be
necessary that it shall harmonise with the features; you
must carry your perception backwards to the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>that this face presented when he had only attained the
age of thirty: this will be the art and science expected at
your hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not to lengthen this my introductory lecture, by labouring
to define the various types of English faces, when the
bones are covered with the soft parts, I have selected a few
outlines of faces such as a sculptor and painter would
study. Cast your eye upward, you will see that each
possesses its own characteristic and alterable features.
So in life; and if you gentlemen are to be true Dental
Surgeons, you must rise to the ideal of artistic mechanics.
If I am to benefit you to the full bent of my
wishes, you must study nature in all its variety—nature
when presented to you as destroyed by premature disease
and death, to be restored by your hand to its original conformation.
Remember that use must follow beauty, one
cannot be dissevered from the other if you would obtain
results, complete in power of mastication, speech, durability,
and appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>To win success in appearance, you must study the
irregularities of the natural projection of circle, and the
character of circle. If any irregularities are observed,
take a model cast of the mouth, so that you can compare
the natural organs whilst the artificial are in progress
of arrangement; modify these irregularities, but do not
efface their existence altogether. The general conformation
of the Dental organs and the face must be your
special study. The colour of the teeth to be selected must
receive at your hands great care: compare the various
tints at your disposal, ascertain if a perfect self colour, or a
tinted, shaded, or stained tooth is the most pleasing; which
will harmonise best with the complexion, producing a
natural effect. It will be your object to disguise that the
new introductions are foreign bodies, endeavour to make
them appear as if they possessed life. Many colours absorb
so much light that at night the appearance they present
is black and death-like. Avoid such shades, select those
that reflect light; in many cases the teeth should be almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>transparent. The colour of the hair, the nature of the
complexion will guide you in this endeavour; hair and
complexion must harmonise. A heavy, wavy head of hair,
dark and massive, with bronzed face would indicate a
strong shaded tooth, solid in character and non-transparent,
yet a colour that will reflect rather than absorb the rays of
light. A Saxon face with fair hair will strongly puzzle
you at times; the pearl hued, thin and transparent teeth, as
a rule, are appropriate for such a face.</p>

<p class='c008'>When articulating the dentures, every care must be taken
and much thought and study bestowed to adjust the depth
and height of the superior and inferior dentures to the
length and depth, to the thickness or thinness of the lips.
Note and estimate the loss of structure by absorption, and
supply in proportion to the loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>The circle and projection as above alluded to will be
your special study. Give hours to produce a natural expression.
Propose to the patient a short walk in your
operating room; if a good corridor is at your disposal, so
much the better, use it. By so doing you will ascertain
what, if any, old habit of contortion of features is indulged
in by the patient; the character of the laugh, if the lips are
raised, and how much; at times only the tips of the teeth
are manifest, at others the full lip is raised exposing to
view the crown of the tooth and the alveolus, even to the
lower margin of the meatus of the nose. Arrangements
equal to all these expressions must be adopted. The how,
will be told you in future lectures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, again, the smile; the smile of a Desdemona and
the smile of an Iago! yet how much in a smile! Harmonise
your mechanism so that the smile of the patient shall be
rendered as natural and full of meaning as art can make
it. The movements of the lips and tongue in speech
must be as carefully studied; the eloquence of the orator
and the no less eloquent prattle of a pretty woman.
During the visit of your patient strike out a conversation
that shall put him at his ease, and show him at his best;
this will aid you in observing what is required to render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>conversation easy to himself and acceptable to his hearers.
Notice that the head is never carried in a perpendicular
line with the body; at times it leans to the right or the
left, the effect of this inclination is to lengthen in appearance
the teeth of the incline. Notice also, many patients
have the ungainly habit of twisting the lips out of the
natural line of the head and face.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is by attention to all these details that the results
of your work will be noble, your claims to reward great,
your satisfaction not less in its kind than that of the sculptor
or the painter; whilst they can only charm the happy,
it is yours to relieve the suffering, to alleviate pain, and
even to prolong life and restore lost beauty.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The first business before the meeting was the reading of the
minutes of the last meeting. They were taken as read.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following letter was read by the Secretary (Dr. W. H.
Waite):—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>“<i>To the Hon. Sec. of the Midland Branch of the British Dental Association.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—I have much pleasure in informing you, that at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>meeting of the business Committee of the representative Board of
the British Dental Association, held on the 1st instant, Edward
Saunders, Esq., in the chair, the proposed bye-laws having been
approved of, the Midland Counties Branch of the British Dental
Association was formally affiliated with the Central Body.</p>

<p class='c010'>“According to the desire of the meeting, I have to convey to you
our best wishes for the success of your efforts.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The report which was then read by the Secretary, was as
follows:—</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c015'>REPORT OF COUNCIL.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As this is a Special, and not an Ordinary General Meeting, and
as the Council have only met once, there is not much upon which
they can report. In accordance with the resolution adopted at
the last meeting, circulars inviting practitioners in the Midland
District to join the Association, were issued to every name on the
Register. Up to the first of August, the Secretary had enrolled
33 members and 6 associates, and since that date there have been
six applications for membership, five of which the Council have
this day admitted, viz., Messrs. R. Rogers, Cheltenham; T. C.
Parson, Clifton, Bristol; T. Wormald, Oldham; B. L. Harding,
Manchester; W. H. Ridge, Stafford. The election of members
will be by ballot, at the Council meeting following the date of application,
and the vote of two-thirds of those present, will be
necessary to ensure election.</p>

<p class='c008'>A book has been provided for the entry of names of members
attending the meetings, and your Council have further arranged
for the admission of visitors, each member having the privilege to
admit two visitors, whose names and addresses should be entered
in a column provided for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Council have nominated Mr Major Stewart of Liverpool, as
first Vice-President of the branch, and they recommend that the
Annual Meeting in April next be held in Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c008'>An analysis of the Dentists Register shews that 1,400 names
have been enrolled, of gentlemen engaged in the practice of
Dentistry, in the Midland Counties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of these, about half are registered as practising in conjunction
with pharmacy, and of these last, a considerable number—are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>names not to be found in the Chemists’ and Druggists’ Directory.
Some difficulty is encountered in attempts to verify cases of incorrect
registration on account of changes of residences, alterations
or errors in spelling, &amp;c., this pertains to both the Dentists’ and
Chemists’ Directory, so that it is not easy to identify positively in
all instances. If gentlemen, who may be aware of the facts in
any locality, would be at the pains to collect them, and submit
them in a concise form, so as to furnish clear and trustworthy
evidence of fraudulent registration, it would be of great service.
Any one practising Dentistry, but who is not on the register, or
anyone on the register, who can be shown not to have been in the
practice of dentistry at the date of the Act, these are the two
kinds of error it is desirable to expose.</p>

<p class='c008'>It need scarcely be stated that an increase of members, both of
the Central Association, and its separate branches, is absolutely
necessary to enable the Executive to carry out the provisions of
the Act, and there is little doubt that with moderate effort, we
may all succeed in inducing others to join. The Association is
destined to represent the profession in the future, and it is our
business to make its representative character a living reality, and
not a mere empty name.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>J. S. Crapper</span> (Hanley), moved the adoption of the report.
It was seconded by Mr. Headridge (Manchester), and carried.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Major <span class='sc'>Stewart</span>, of Liverpool, said that as his name had been
mentioned in the report, he begged to thank them for the honour
they had conferred on him by electing him Vice-President of the
branch. He thanked them, on behalf of his brethren in Liverpool,
for the honour the Society had conferred on them.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c015'>THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>President</span> then delivered his address, and said:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Gentlemen,—It is my pleasing duty in the first place to
thank you, not only for the kindness you have shown in
electing me to the responsible position of President of
your Branch, but also for having given me the honour of
being the First President of the First Branch of the British
Dental Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>I need scarcely say that the fact of our meeting here to-day
as we are now doing is a subject for congratulation,
and the presence of so many, and the distance some of you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>have come, proves the interest you take in the great movement
of the day, which has called into existence the central
Society of which we now form a branch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every new movement is sure to give rise to more or less
excitement and sometimes to great expectations, and I
must, therefore, beg, first for myself, your kind forbearance
for my numerous shortcomings, of which I am only too
conscious; and secondly, for your society I must also ask
your kind consideration, if at the first it seems to you
scarcely to come up to the high standard of your anticipations,
requesting you to remember that it is still in its
infancy, that it has commenced its existence under difficulties,
and I regret to say, not without some opposition.
It will, therefore, require care and energy, not only on the
part of the Executive body, but also in each individual
member, to bring it to that state of maturity we all are
anxious to see it attain. I feel certain from your presence
here to-day that you have the interest of the Society at
heart, but I venture to remind you that the simply feeling
an interest in a thing is not sufficient in itself to command
success. <i>That</i> is a result which requires, especially in these
days, both energy and labour, and we must never forget
that our future position and progress as a Society, will
mainly depend on our own individual efforts, since we are
each of us an individual unit, the aggregate of which units
forms the Society itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be natural for you to expect in this, the first
introductory paper, a history of the origin and objects of
the Society, but these were so ably treated of by the
worthy Secretary of the Society on his visit to Manchester,
and so many of you were present at the London meetings,
and so much has been already written on the subject, that
it would not only be superfluous but also presumptuous for
me to attempt what has already been done by others so
much more competent than myself, and I am therefore deprived
of what would have been an interesting topic for
an address; but although the past and the present have
thus been taken from me, there still remains the future;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>and as I hope that in that future our Midland branch will
ultimately form a not unimportant unit, I will therefore
restrict what I have to say mainly to the subject of the
branch itself, and in doing so must crave your kind indulgence
for the many imperfections in my efforts, urging as
my excuse the little time that numerous professional and
other engagements leave at my disposal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, I think, we may congratulate ourselves, that we
exist as a branch of the British Dental Association and not
as an independent Society, for I am sure we all feel that
the scheme for the elevation of our profession to its proper
position, which that Society has been formed to promote,
has been most judiciously planned, and has thus far been
most efficiently carried out—a scheme, which whilst it in
no way discourages the attainment of the higher qualification
of full membership of the Royal College of Surgeons,
in those who are anxious to distinguish themselves, and
possess the means and opportunity for so doing, provides
an efficient education in all those scientific and practical
subjects which it is necessary for a Dentist to know, and
by means of the Dental Diploma, affords the public a guarantee
that the possessor of that diploma has passed through
a curriculum of such a standard as fully to qualify him for
the practice of the branch of surgery which he professes.
Nor must we allow to pass unnoticed the utter unselfishness
of its promoters, who laboured out of pure love for their
profession, knowing that they could never expect to see
the good result of their labours in their lifetime, unlike the
man who is said to have remarked that he never could see
the good posterity had done for him that he need trouble
himself about posterity: and as was the case with many of
those grand memorials of the loving zeal and devotion of
our ancestors, those noble cathedrals with which so many
parts of our country are adorned, one generation was satisfied
if they were able to lay the foundations and were
permitted to see some portion of the superstructure erected
during their lifetime, so in like manner, we must wait and
not be discouraged if we are unable to see the full development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>of the present movement, but should consider it a
privilege to be permitted to assist in however humble a
degree, in taking part in what we fondly and reasonably
hope will prove the formation of a grand future for our
branch of surgery.</p>

<p class='c008'>To our Secretary and Treasurer are due, I believe, the
credit of having originated the branch, and I take this
opportunity of saying that I am unable in any way to
claim a portion of that credit for myself, for I gather from
a letter in one of the journals, that I was not only believed
to have been one of the promoters, but that I was thought
to have been guilty of an act of discourtesy in what I had
done, or rather in what I had not done. I knew nothing
of the project till I received a printed circular inviting my
co-operation, and it was not till after the lapse of many
weeks that I found myself able to join in the scheme.
The promoters worked hard in drafting the bye-laws and
arranging the other necessary preliminaries, but I am sure
I may say for them that they feel amply rewarded by seeing
their pet child, over which they have laboured so long,
fully recognised as a legitimate offspring of the British
Dental Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>The objects of the branch, you see by the bye-laws, are
fourfold:—</p>

<p class='c008'>1. To render assistance, as far as possible, in carrying
out the provisions of the Dentists Act.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The general consideration of subjects affecting the
interests of the profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The reading and discussion of papers on Dental Surgery
and Mechanics.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The cultivation of a generous professional spirit
amongst practitioners throughout the district.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to the first object, I think the purport of
the Act is so clear that it requires but few remarks from
me. It is impossible to draw any definite line where the
help of an unqualified person must cease and that of the
duly qualified practitioner commence. Any one who
dresses a wound or a bruise, or reduces a dislocation, practises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>surgery, and no one could for a moment imagine that
a law would ever be passed to prevent his doing so; and
in like manner, we could not expect that the legislature
would ever allow the drawing of a tooth or any other similar
operation to be made a penal action, although the person
so doing may be said to be practising Dentistry; but
as soon as any one endeavours to make the public believe
he is a qualified practitioner, by assuming the title of
Dentist or any other name implying the possession of the
Dental diploma, so soon he becomes amenable to the law;
the act thus guaranteeing to the public, that <i>for the future</i>,
any one who claims the professional title shall of necessity
have obtained the necessary qualification. Any person, or
any number of persons, who may wish to put the act in
force in any particular case can do so, but before taking
action it will be necessary to obtain the sanction of the
Medical Council. This at first sight may seem to be an
unnecessary precaution, yet I think on further consideration
you will admit that it is a very wise provision, as it
entirely prevents the possibility of any one being proceeded
against from personal pique or any other improper motive;
and if in any case it is thought desirable that a person’s
name should be removed from the register, all that is
necessary is to collect sufficient <i>reliable</i> evidence, and
transmit it to the central board in London, who will bring
the matter before the Medical Council, the only body by
whom such action can be taken. And in cases where these
proceedings may be necessary, I am sure they can be carried
out without earning for ourselves the opprobrium of
acting as spies or professional police, which some have already
been willing to assign to us.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the second object of the Society, we
must all feel that the interests of the profession will at
times require the careful consideration of its members, and
necessitate the existence of some organised body which
shall be able to act with the authority of the bulk of its
members, and for this, no better scheme can be devised
than the one we are now so much interested in—the formation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>of a central society, with recognised branches in the
more distant parts of the country, constituting an organisation
by which the feeling of the majority of the profession
may at any time be ascertained on any question that may
arise bearing on the well being of the profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the third object, “The reading and discussion of
papers on Dental Surgery and Mechanics,” the surgery you
will notice is placed first, and justly so, as the higher
branch; though in early times, and I fear even to a more
recent date, the order in importance was more frequently
reversed in practice. The mere mechanical calling of former
times—for in its infancy Dentistry was little else—has
now been developed into a profession and gained admission
within the sacred portals of the College in Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, and it is for the present and future generations to
prove by the exercise of their highest mental as well as
mechanical faculties, that the profession is worthy of the
position which has been accorded to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been noticed by those who most frequently attend
the meetings of our speciality, that papers on mechanical
subjects are more easily procured, and often prove more
attractive than those on surgical subjects, but this will no
doubt become less as the educational facilities of the present
day are brought to bear more and more on the whole
body of the profession. Surely the preservation of the
natural organs is of far more importance and value to the
patient than the substitution of others, however efficiently
supplied.</p>

<p class='c008'>What should we think of the surgeon who allowed himself
to be deterred from directing all his energies to the
preservation and restoration to health, of a diseased or
injured limb, by the thought that an artificial substitute
could be provided for it. No! No! Whatever our politics
may be let our surgery be conservative. Far be it from
me to appear to undervalue any branch of my profession,
for no one can have been long in practice without having
experienced the well earned gratification derived from
noticing the relief from pain, and in many instances the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>perfect restoration to health, that follows the substitution
of efficient members in the place of useless and diseased
ones; but far greater is the credit and higher the appreciation
of the patient, when the diseased natural organs
themselves can be preserved and restored to a state of
efficiency; and how great are the facilities for so doing in
the present day, compared with the early reminiscences
of many of our older brethren. All of us who were
fortunate enough to hear the interesting paper read
before the General Meeting of the Society in August last,
must have been forcibly struck with the contrast between
the paucity and quality of the instruments there mentioned,
and the appliances of the present day. What would
have been the feelings—I might almost say the bewilderment
of the practitioner therein described, could he have
been transported into one of the large depôts with which
we are so familiar. The numerous and beautifully adapted
instruments for the variety of operations unknown in those
days. The admirably adjusted forces for each form of
tooth, the endless variety of excavators and pluggers, the
wonderfully delicate nerve extractors, the rubber dam and
its adjustments, the saliva pump, the electric mallet, the
improvement in our chairs, and that greatest of all boons,
both to patient and operator, the Morrison engine, the
name of the inventor of which valuable instrument, ought
to be indelibly inscribed in letters of gold in the Archives of
Dentistry, to say nothing of the application of vulcanite and
celluloid, and the many ingenious appliances for the workshop.
Surely these should lead us to value the benefits we
enjoy, and teach us to strive to use them to the best of our
ability, not influenced by the thought of self-glorification
in attempting to surpass all others, in the performance of
this or that brilliant operation, but ever remembering that
the ultimate aim of all our efforts should be the increased
amount of good which we are thereby enabled to accomplish
for the benefit of our suffering fellow-creatures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the <cite>Transactions</cite> of the Odontological Society
contain a very voluminous and valuable collection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>papers bearing on one speciality, there still remain
numerous subjects and modes of operating which may be
made productive of profitable discussion. Such are the
replantation of teeth now attracting so much attention,
the erosion of the surfaces of the teeth of which so little
is known in the present day. The various improvements
in the materials for filling, and amongst a variety of
subjects, far too numerous to be mentioned here, the
startling announcement of the so-called New Departure
Creed.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this last is a subject which I think we all feel greatly
interested in, and also bears on the branch of Dentistry
which we are now considering, I will venture a few
remarks on some of the articles of the accepted and new
departure creeds as tabulated in the <cite>Dental Cosmos</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am not aware that the so-called accepted creed has
been the recognised standard of practice in this country.
The doctrine that gold, and nothing but gold, should be used
for permanent fillings, has certainly been extensively promulgated
by those of our Transatlantic brethren who have
settled in this country; and I cannot but look upon this
new departure, as the natural reaction which might be
expected to follow the over anxiety to build up large
adhesive gold fillings, on fragments of weak and often
disorganized teeth, totally unsuited for such an operation;
but until I can see some stronger reason than has been
hitherto adduced by the advocates of this new departure,
I must, in any case suitable for a good gold filling, confess
my unwillingness to abandon for any other of the fillings
now in use, a material that we know from past experience
is capable, when judiciously applied, of preserving and
restoring to a state of efficiency, in some cases for a
period of twenty years or even for a much longer time,
teeth which otherwise would have been lost in about the
same number of months. For the efficient use of this
material much must of course depend on the manipulative
ability of the operator, but it has often seemed to me a
matter of doubt, whether, in the case of those large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>adhesive gold fillings, the patient has received an equivalent
for the tedious and necessarily expensive operation
that has been undergone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The choice between contour fillings and separation of
the teeth in the case of approximal cavities, must, I think,
depend in a measure on the aptitude and judgment of the
operator, since the two plans when successfully performed,
may be made equally efficient. The latter however—separation—seems
to afford greater facilities for operating,
and also for cleanliness in those patients who are unable
or unwilling to devote the time and attention necessary
for that object.</p>

<p class='c008'>The professed incompatibility of gold as a filling
material with tooth bone, seems to me to be at variance
with the frequent success which we all must have experienced,
in the use of that filling in cavities on the labial
surface of the roots of the upper incisors. I mention this
particular position as being easy of access for operating,
and also as being one where the enamel, tooth bone, gold,
and saliva, are in constant contact with each other. In
those cases where the success of the operation has not
equalled our expectations, in endeavouring to estimate
the probable incompatibility of the filling material as a
cause of failure, it is, I think, necessary to consider
whether in the ordinary operation for filling, the whole of
the diseased dentine has been so thoroughly removed, as
to admit of its proving a satisfactory test case, for the
microscope reveals to us a change in the dentine in the
sides of a decayed cavity, even when it appears sound to
the eye, and also to the feel of the instrument; and in
those portions of the margin of the cavity which we
undercut for the retention of the filling, we have the
dentine not only denuded of its nutrient covering, the
periosteum, but also deprived of its nutrition from the pulp
by the severance of the tubes of the dentine, and the
intervention of the filling material, and in this deteriorated
condition, in all probability still exposed to the continuous
action of the same deleterious influences (whatever they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>may have been) which first caused the decay; and I
cannot but think that the failure when it occurs, is in a
greater measure due to the above named causes, rather
than to the incompatibility of the gold with the tooth
bone; but with all the success that has attended the use
of gold for so many years, we must still, I am sure, be
willing to admit the want of a perfect plastic filling,
which shall be able to withstand the friction of mastication,
and also the deleterious action of the fluids of the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dictum that, “a tooth that can be so treated as to
be satisfactorily filled with anything, is worth filling,” is
one, I think, that all who value conservative surgery must
readily agree with.</p>

<p class='c008'>That “unskilful and unscrupulous Dentists fill with tin
covered with gold, thereby causing galvanic action,
pulpitis, death of the pulp, abscess, and loss of the tooth,”
has certainly not been an accepted creed in this country,
for I was early taught the use of this material both alone,
and in combination with gold, when I first commenced
the study of my profession with Mr. Sheffield, of Exeter,
and long experience, and the retention of a tin filling in
my own mouth, in a perfect condition for over five-and-twenty
years, has fully proved to me the value of this
metal. When used in combination with gold, and exposed
to contact with the fluids of the mouth, it certainly undergoes
a chemical change, becoming nearly black in colour,
but without staining the tooth as some amalgams do; it
also becomes harder, and cuts harsh like an amalgam
filling, but the change does not appear to cause any
alteration in its bulk, or in any respect to interfere with
its efficiency as a filling, nor have I ever found it produce
any of the evils suggested in the creed, and I cannot but
think that it would be more used, were it not for the
universal prejudice that exists in the mind of the public
in favour of gold, partly arising from the magical charm
which resides in the word gold, and partly from the
nothing but gold theory (if I may so call it), which has
been so largely spread by our American brethren.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>That “a filling may be the best known for a tooth and
yet leak badly,” seems a simple admission that in some
cases bad is the best that we can do for them. If experience
has taught us anything, it certainly has proved that
it is the leak which does the mischief; and as in warfare
no fortress is considered stronger than its weakest part, so
is it with a tooth that is filled. A small leaking point will
soon undermine the filling, and prove its ruin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The statement that “gutta-percha <i>properly used</i> is the
<i>most permanent</i> filling material we possess,” must make us
wish to know the meaning of the words, “properly used,”
for the rapidity with which it wears away, in any position
in which it is subjected to friction in mastication, seems to
me to prevent the possibility of its ever being permanent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The force of the article which says that “a poor gutta-percha
filling, <i>in its proper place</i>, is better than a <i>good</i> gold
one,” seems to depend on the question as to what is the
proper place for a gutta-percha filling: surely not the
place where we can insert a good gold plug, if by “good,”
is meant one that is not only solid, but also sufficiently
tight to exclude all moisture from the cavity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It certainly is rather startling to hear from the country
from which have come the severest criticisms on the use
and the users of amalgam fillings, the admission that
“amalgam per se, is an excellent filling material.” With
amalgams, as with the other plastic materials, a <i>perfect</i>
filling of its kind has yet to be discovered, for a measure
of uncertainty seems to exist in all of them; but as a
proof that an amalgam <i>may</i> make a good useful filling, I
can say that I have seen more than one apparently in a
perfect condition after thirty years’ wear, and I cannot but
think that much of the discredit attaching to its use, arises
from its being the filling we naturally have recourse to in
all cases of doubt and difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>That “the use of plastic filling material tends to lower
the standard of Dentistry, thereby diminishing its sphere
of usefulness,” is scarcely a fair way of stating the matter.
The indiscriminate use of them would certainly do so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>but the judicious selection of them in cases unsuited for
the use of gold, need not necessarily interfere with the
acquirement of the manipulative ability necessary for
making good gold fillings, nor is it desirable that it should
do so, as the power of manipulation required for the
successful use of gold, must tend to perfect the powers of
the operator in the use of all plastic materials, and must
thus extend the sphere of usefulness of that Dentistry
which has for its standard of excellency, ability to save
teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Time has only permitted me very briefly to notice some
portions of this new creed, to show that it contains much
that might be productive of profitable discussion, but I
think from what has been said, we may reasonably conclude
that each material has its own particular advantages,
and that until we are in possession of a filling suitable for
universal application, a judicious selection is necessary on
the part of the operator in each particular case.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fourth, and not the least important object of the
society is “the cultivation of a generous professional
spirit amongst practitioners throughout the district,” and
to this I hope may be added throughout the whole body
of the profession; for the knowledge that we are branches
of one central society, should lead to a feeling of fellowship
not only with the members of the parent society, but also
with the members of the other branches, and surely it is not
too much to hope, that with the extension of the Society
and its branches, and the feeling of professional brotherhood
thereby engendered, we may see the gradual increase
of that Christian charity which “thinketh no evil,” and
which would scorn all attempts at self-exaltation, by the
disparagement of the efforts and qualifications of a fellow
practitioner, which I fear has been greatly encouraged by
the isolation that has so long existed in our speciality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor must we omit to notice the great benefit to be
derived from the friendly discussion of subjects in which
we are all mutually interested, not only to the profession
at large, but also to each one individually, for which of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>in his early days has not felt the wish that he had thought
of this or that other mode of treatment in some particular
case; and what more likely to impress new ideas on the
memory, or, to use a familiar expression, make us “have
them at our fingers’ ends” (the place where surely they
are wanted when operating), than the friendly discussion
of them which it is one of the objects of our Society to
encourage?</p>

<p class='c008'>The President of the Western branch has held out to us
the hand of fellowship, which I am sure I need not
ask your permission to be allowed to reciprocate most
fully—not only in the wish for their future prosperity, but
also in the assurance that any of their members who may
have an opportunity of attending our meetings, will at all
times receive that cordial welcome which it should be our
greatest pleasure to extend to all the members of our
Society and its branches, thus realizing one of the great
objects of our Association, and proving not only by our
words, but also by our actions, that we are anxious to
encourage that professional intercourse which must tend
not only to our mutual benefit, but also to that of the
community at large; and if, as their President remarked,
it is a pleasure to them to think that in the formation of
our branch we show “the benefits resulting from the good
example they have set us,” it is no less a subject of congratulation
to us to know that they have at last recognised
the good which is likely to accrue, both to themselves and
to the profession generally, by following our example, and
forming themselves into a local branch of the British
Dental Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now, fearing that I have already trespassed too
long on your time and forbearance, it only remains for me
to thank you for the kind reception you have accorded me,
and to express the belief that, although the barque which
we have so successfully launched will probably meet with
the usual amount of storms and difficulties, still the old
proverbial “long pull and a strong pull and a pull all
together,” in which you are so able and willing to join,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>will carry it securely through the many undercurrents and
quicksands which may threaten it on its course, and secure
what we all so ardently hope for—a useful, as well as a
long and prosperous career, for the Midland Branch of the
British Dental Association.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Mahonie</span> (Sheffield), moved a vote of thanks to the
President for his able and eloquent address, and in doing so, said
that when the Association was weak, Mr. Campion had come to
their aid in a very courteous manner, and they were now asked to
give him their heartiest thanks for the paper which they had just
heard read. The paper was one which would last more than a
year. It was very instructive, and he (Mr. Mahonie) thought
that Mr. Campion was eminently capable of giving them instructions
in the way of Dental Reform. He moved “That the best
thanks of this meeting be given to the President of the Midland
Counties Branch of the British Dental Association, for the able
and eloquent paper which he had just read.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. W. H. Nicol (Leeds), seconded the motion in suitable
terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. W. H. Waite in supporting the motion, said that it was a
very great privilege for them to have such a President as they had
in Mr. Campion. His wisdom had been of great service in superintending
the efforts which the Executive have had to put forth.
They had been delighted that morning with the interesting and
instructive address which Mr. Campion had given them, but most
of all with the very high and generous tone that breathed throughout
the whole of the address, and he (Dr. Waite) thought Mr.
Campion had struck a key-note which, when the address came
to be printed, would vibrate not only throughout the Midland
Counties of England, but through every country where the Dental
profession was carried on. The motion was carried with much
enthusiasm, and the meeting then adjourned till the afternoon.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c008'>The Members assembled in the Memorial Hall at 2.30 p.m.,
Mr. Campion in the chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>President</span> stated that some idea had been started of bringing
specimens to the meeting, and in order to show what curiosities
might be casually collected, he offered a few specimens to the notice
of the Members.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>Mr. <span class='sc'>Roff King</span>, Shrewsbury, then read a paper on “Modelling
and Modelling Composition.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>J. S. Crapper</span> (Hanley) read a paper, entitled “New Ideas
in Mechanical Dentistry,” and exhibited specimens of teeth which
had been manufactured by a new process and sent to him to
exhibit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Secretary</span> read a paper received from Mr. F. Richardson,
Derby—“Has Vaccination any Effect on the Degeneration of the
Teeth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>H. Marsh</span> (Manchester) read a paper on the “Use of
Nitrous Oxide Gas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Murphy</span> desired to ask the Chairman whether Licentiates in
Dental Surgery were legally responsible if a patient expired whilst
under the influence of the nitrous oxide gas, or subsequently to the
administration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the discussion which followed, there appeared to be a unanimous
opinion amongst those present that Licentiates were not
responsible, but that it would be impossible to define such a
position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Secretary</span> read a letter from Mr. Kyan of Preston, in
which that gentleman expressed his regret at his inability to be
present, and hoped the Members would have a successful meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Renshaw</span> moved a vote of thanks to those gentlemen who
had furnished them with such interesting and instructive papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. <span class='sc'>D. A. Wormald</span>, in seconding the resolution, said they
could, with a little energy and support, make that Society very
successful, and as a representative body on behalf of their profession
in the Midland Counties, they could maintain such a position
that it would become an honour to belong to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Chairman</span> remarked that it was no light work to prepare
such papers as they had heard read; much time and trouble must
have been spent in the digest of the various subjects. He gave
the hearty thanks of the meeting to the contributors of those
papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Major <span class='sc'>Stewart</span> proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Campion
for presiding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>King</span> seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Chairman</span> (Mr. Campion) returned his best thanks for the
kind reception and assistance the Members had rendered him
whilst in the chair.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE DINNER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In the evening a dinner was held at the Queen’s Hotel, Mr.
Campion presiding, Mr. Major Stewart in the vice-chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Chairman</span> proposed the health of  “The Queen and the rest
of the Royal Family.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Mahonie</span> then gave a recitation from Shakespeare.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Major <span class='sc'>Stewart</span> in rising to propose the toast of the
President of the branch said—It is my pleasing duty as your Vice-President
to propose this toast. I find our worthy Chairman took
his M.R.C.S. degree in 1856, I therefore regard him as the father
of the profession in this district of England; those who were
present this morning heard his inaugural address. Those words
were words of wisdom, and were addressed not only to the older,
but also to the younger members of our Branch Association. His
address will be read with pleasure by members of our profession
in England and America. With regard to the chairmanship of
this branch, I think it would have been wise if Mr. Campion had
been elected for three years, until we were more consolidated. I
am glad to see so many members from this district present
this evening, and will now conclude by asking you to drink a
bumper to the long life and successful career of our Chairman.
The toast was accepted most loyally.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Chairman</span> in responding said, gentlemen, you must have
listened to my voice sufficiently to-day—this is my last appearance
before you this session. Our Secretary has promised to allow me
to enjoy myself, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">otium cum dignitate</span></i>, after I have returned my best
thanks. It is with great diffidence I respond to this toast, I really
feel the difficulty increased tenfold by the kind manner in which
you, sir, have proposed, and my friends accepted this toast. One
word in regard to sub-branches—I can see no reason why such
large towns as Liverpool and Manchester should not establish sub-branches;
frequent meetings, say once a month, could be held for
an exchange of thoughts and methods of operation in our department
of Surgery, in which we are all interested; so constituted,
they would be private societies, to which any member of our
branch might be admitted. The great event of the next year will
be the meeting of the International Medical Congress, held in
London during August. This Congress has held its meetings
every alternate year for the last twelve years. The London
members of the Medical profession have taken it up very warmly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>and are making preparations, which must result in giving the
Congress such a reception as will be worthy of our capital.</p>

<p class='c008'>The President of the Dental section is Mr. Edwin Saunders,
whilst the Vice-Presidents are Mr. John Tomes, and Mr. Spence
Bate, Mr. C. S. Tomes acts as Secretary, to all of whom we are
much indebted for their untiring efforts in raising our department
of Surgery to its present position. I trust that our branch will
be well represented at this Congress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another subject I will broach is the establishment of a Dental
School in Manchester. If such a school is formed it should be in
concert with the Manchester Medical School at the New Victoria
University. When the charter was first granted for the formation
of a university, a medical school was not included, but there
appears very little doubt that in the course of time such school
will be established; let us then wait patiently until we can
thoroughly and efficiently carry out such an undertaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am sorry I cannot introduce you to a Dental hospital; this is
to be deplored, more especially as we took a prominent part in
Dental reform for the good of Dental practitioners. If younger
and more able men will commence the work, they shall receive my
heartiest support and co-operation. I must now conclude by expressing
regret that I have not the gift of speech, that I might
explain to you the warm feelings I have in regard to the reception
you have given me, and the kind manner in which you have drunk
my health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. <span class='sc'>D. A. Wormald</span> sang “The Spinning Wheel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Wormald</span>, in proposing “The British Dental Association,”
said: Mr. President, and gentlemen, this toast is one, I am sure,
you will drink with the utmost cordiality. Those who sit round
this board, and have taken a part during the past few years in the
politics of our profession, must experience a feeling of congratulation
that we are able to meet to-night, and realize the fact that at
last we occupy a recognized position. We need re-organization,
and we need a central body, and the British Dental Association is
that recognized body, and demands our support and assistance.
Well, join that Association, and do what you can to lift up the
profession from the low level in which we have been placed, and
raise it to a much higher level. We need, as your President so
kindly put it this afternoon, a higher professional tone, and a more
generous feeling towards our brethren; and that can only be obtained
by coming more and more in contact with each other, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>through the influence of such an organization as this we are met
to commence, which will assist in placing our profession in a
position which it should long ago have occupied. Many of those
who are now in our ranks may not see the full result of our
labours, but depend upon this, that our labours will be recognised
in the great difference which will show itself more and more in
this country between those who are worthily following their
calling, and those who indulge in non-professional practices. The
British Dental Association will become strong and durable, and
then we may be sure that under the wisdom and the guidance of
those who have piloted our steps so far, we may safely follow them
wherever they lead, and so lay a foundation upon which the rising
generation may build up their professional career, and help to raise
the status of our profession. That profession is worthy of
all the time and attention that any honourable gentleman
will give it, if he will follow his calling worthily, and serving
the interests of a suffering public. In connection with this toast,
Mr. Chairman, my friend Dr. Waite, will have the pleasure of responding,
and I have the greatest pleasure in coupling his name
with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Waite</span> responding, said, Mr. President, Mr. Vice-President,
and gentlemen, it is to me both a pleasure and a pride to be
permitted to respond to the toast of the “British Dental Association.”
I am not much of a believer in post-prandial oratory.
The period of replenishment for the physical energies, should be a
period of repose for the energies intellectual, or perhaps better
still, a time of refreshment, by agreeable and amusing conversation.
That Englishmen should be fond of dining together, is
natural and characteristic; that they should be almost equally
prone to after dinner speechifying is somewhat surprising. It is
well, however, when the usages imposed by custom can be observed,
without making a too serious demand upon our drowsy powers,
and fortunately we have a condition of things existing at the
present time which, when fairly estimated, is calculated to awaken
agreeable reflections, and inspire us with salutary hopes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the short space of five years, events have occurred with
astonishing rapidity, that have substantially and permanently
altered the position of the Dental profession, not alone in its
relation to the general public, but also in its internal organisation,
and the mutual relation of individuals to the whole body. These
events may be classified in three distinct items, and in each we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>shall find elements of progress largely preponderating. First of
all, most of you will recall the feeling which prevailed when the
idea of obtaining an Act of Parliament was invoked at the Manchester
meeting of 1875—it was not regarded exactly as an utopian
idea, but certainly we felt it to be something almost too good to
hope for. Well, in less than three years from that time the
Dentists Act was passed, and now, after two years experience
and consideration, we are able to discover what it is we have
obtained, though it is all too soon as yet, to realise (except very
partially) the practical benefits the Act is destined to confer. This
much, however, we know. We have a legal status. We have
legal rights and privileges. We are admitted to the fellowship of
the honourable and learned professions. These three points are
assured, and we should see to it, that we interpose no barrier of
professional character or conduct between ourselves and the
privileges our Act bestows. We know, moreover, that there are
secured for those who will come after us, more substantial benefits
of education, of practice, of public appreciation, such as none of
us have been permitted to enjoy. This is the characteristic feature
of the Dentists Act. Its noblest provisions are for posterity.
No change, nor circumstance, can deprive any who have assisted
in passing this Act, of the pure satisfaction of knowing that they
have helped to hand on the profession of Dental Surgery in a far
better condition than that in which they received it. Many have
contributed in various ways, whose share in the work will be forgotten,
but the work remains. Identified with the whole of the
movement, the names of Tomes and Turner will be preserved and
revered for many, many years, yet withal the abundant reasons
for personal gratification which those gentlemen have, I am sure
they rejoice a thousand fold more over the results achieved, than
they do at any honour or advantage accruing to themselves.
Take it as it stands, acknowledging its few imperfections, and
recognising its many decided benefits, we have as good an Act as
we had any right to expect, and as good as it was possible for us
to get.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the hindrances to Dental advancement has hitherto been
the scarcity of educational facilities, and the small proportion of
practitioners who possessed any Dental qualification. At the
time to which reference has already been made, there were only
some 300 gentlemen in the whole of Great Britain who held a
Dental diploma. There was only one licensing body in the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>which granted Dental certificates. Now we have 630 gentlemen
holding recognised Dental qualifications, viz., of London about
400, Edinburgh 16, Dublin 180, Glasgow 33, and the three last
mentioned bodies are offering to gentlemen in practice, the opportunity
of examination, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine curriculo</span></i>, upon thoroughly reasonable
and accessible terms. Not only so, the Colleges of Ireland and
Scotland have caused their certificates to possess a peculiar value,
in the careful provision they have made, for preventing unprofessional
practices on the part of their licentiates.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am certainly astonished that the number of practitioners who
have already availed themselves of these facilities is so small. I
know that this matter of obtaining a Qualification is regarded
variously by different persons, but nothing is more certain than
the growing tendency toward accredited qualification as indispensable
to professional status; the public are rapidly becoming
aware (and it is our business to educate the public in this matter)
that the operations of Dental Surgery cannot be safely entrusted
to uneducated heads or hands, and as a guarantee of something
like the necessary knowledge and skill, the public are beginning to
understand the value of a purely Dental Qualification. The larger
the number of Licentiates the more quickly the public will be
taught, and ere long the unqualified Dentist will become a mere
historic fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>The all important feature of recent progress is the British
Dental Association. The Dental body has been afflicted with inherent
weakness through the want of organisation, a weakness that
paralyses, and at the same time, a weakness endowed with remarkable
power, the power of successfully defeating efforts toward
general reformation. So long as we were isolated and detached it
is not wonderful that we were selfish and afraid of one another,
but a new era has dawned. We have an Association to which all
are eligible, where all can meet on the common ground of professional
brotherhood and intercourse. The control of the Association,
embracing the future welfare of the whole body, is committed
to a Board constituted on a representative basis. None need be
excluded from participation, save by their own poverty of professional
spirit, a poverty exhibited alike by persistent recourse to unprofessional
practice, and by selfish indifference to professional
politics. There may be a kind of superiority in having a large
practice, or in holding a high scientific position, but unless I am
greatly mistaken the true superiority is that which overleaps all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>selfish considerations, and delights in consecrating whatever power
or position we may have to the elevation and improvement of the
whole profession. Thank God we have men who have been inspired
with a large measure of true professional spirit. Men who
could think for themselves and hold their own opinions, but who
at the same time have been large-hearted enough to merge minor
differences in the pursuit of one grand object. Such men as Edwin
Saunders, John Tomes, J. Smith-Turner, T. A. Rogers, A.
Coleman, Dr. Walker, our esteemed President, and many others,
stand forth as examples of <i>true</i> as distinct from <i>sham</i> superiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>The facilities now afforded by our separate branches have removed
the excuse so often urged when all the meetings took place in London,
and there is practically no obstacle to our speedy improvement.
We possess advantages of a political nature quite equal to
those existing in any kindred profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>These are the bare facts of the present time; they furnish material
for much thankfulness and for cheerful anticipation. They are the
foundation on which our future must be erected. What that
future is to be depends on what we mean to be. The scaffolding is
up, the materials are ready. Willing hearts and willing hands are
needed to complete the edifice. There is a sublime principle
working through the whole human family, the operation of which
no individual can withstand. It was formulated by the Founder
of the grandest system the world has ever known, and this is the
formula—</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Mahonie</span>, in proposing the toast of “Sir John Lubbock, and
the promoters of the Dentists Act,” said:—No words of mine can
add additional lustre to the names—Sir John Lubbock, Mr. John
Tomes, Mr. James Smith Turner. These men have earned a
name for themselves which neither crayons nor oils—not even if
they were placed in cathedral aisles—could add more; these men
have laboured much—laboured hard; I beg to propose their
health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain <span class='sc'>Rogers</span>, in responding, spoke of the great triumph Sir
John Lubbock had accomplished in passing Bills connected with
science, this Parliament. He had great pleasure in thanking them
for the hearty manner in which they had received the names of
these gentlemen connected with Dental Reform.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr <span class='sc'>T Murphy</span> in proposing the “Manchester School of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>Medicine” said:—I have had put into my hands a toast to propose,
which is so intimately connected with our branch of the
profession, that it will require no eulogy on my part for it to be
received with acclamation, I mean the Manchester Royal School of
Medicine. Perhaps it will not be out of place if I give you a
short outline of its history. It was founded by the late Mr. T.
Turner in the year 1824; it was known for many years as the
Pine Street School. In 1850 a second school was established, and
being connected as I then was with a hospital in this city, I can
well remember the jealousy there was about the subjects that were
sent out; first one school and then another complaining that they
were not getting their fair share, and I must admit that the leaning
was towards the old school, which I think got, on the whole, rather
more than its share. In 1858 the founders of the rival schools
came to the conclusion that the interests of the students would be
best promoted by an amalgamation, forgetting their differences
and working together for the common weal. In this way, from the
Union of the Pine Street and Chatham Street Schools, that school
arose which has been long known as the Manchester School of
Medicine. For sixteen years the work was carried on in Faulkden
Street with difficulty both with regard to accommodation and light.
About the year 1872, a meeting of the Owen’s College authorities
met the leading Members of the medical staff, and it was agreed that
it would be for the welfare of the School if it were handed over to
the Owen’s College authorities. The result has been the erection
of one of the finest Medical Schools in the kingdom, replete with
everything necessary for the study of medicine. The course of
instruction not only enables students to qualify for College and
Hall, but affords the more aspiring every facility for qualifying
themselves for the higher distinctions of their profession.
When I mention the names of Turner, Jordan, Wilson, Smith,
Wilkinson, Bradley, Southam, and last, but not least, the
celebrated Dalton, and others, who have gone; Gamgee, Watson,
Williamson, Roscoe, Roberts, Morgan, Lund, Simpson, Ransome,
and other able men, who are at present at the helm, can there be a
doubt about the quality of the education given? and, in conclusion,
is it too much to ask that before long we should have established in
this city, and in connection with the Victoria University, a Dental
School where we can send our sons to receive at the hands of these
able men the necessary training to fit them for the practice of
Dentistry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>Mr. <span class='sc'>Marsh</span> returned thanks for the toast; he trusted some
day Mr. Campion would be appointed Consulting Dental Surgeon
to the Manchester School of Medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Waite</span> proposed “Success to the Western Counties Association,”
coupling with it the name of Mr. J. C. Parson, of
Clifton.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>MR. SEWILL ON DENTAL CARIES.<br /> <span class='c019'>TO THE EDITORS OF THE “MONTHLY REVIEW OF DENTAL SURGERY.”</span></h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sirs</span>,—While thanking you for your courteous notice of my contribution
to the second edition of Dr. Fothergill’s work, permit me to point out
that my contribution was not intended as an exhaustive discussion of the
subject of dental caries. I was asked to write only upon the “Hygiene
of the Teeth,” and to indicate to the medical practitioner the means
available for the prevention of dental disease. In accordance with the
scheme of the work it was requisite to explain the etiology and pathology
of caries in order to make clear the <i>rationale</i> of treatment, and therefore,
with brevity consistent with the limited space at my disposal, I did so,
adopting mainly what is termed the “chemical” theory of the disease.
This view, as you remark, is certainly “theoretical,” but I venture to
say it approaches as nearly to demonstration as need be. I certainly
do not hesitate to accept it as fact, and I felt more bound to adopt it in
the present instance, seeing, at least, that upon this theory both the
prophylaxis of caries as well as our treatment of the disease seem based.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should be glad to see a discussion of the subject started in your
columns or at the Odontological Society.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>White Nickel Bronze.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The pure white tint of nickel, its inoxidisability, and, therefore, the ease
with which it is kept clean, have caused it to come into general use for
metal fittings, especially those of vessels and carriages, as well as for the
bright parts of engines and machines. But, on account of the relatively
high price hitherto obtained by nickel, it has been employed chiefly in
the state of electro-deposit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nickel-plating is effected by two processes, one hot and the other cold.
In the former a solution of sulphate of nickel is used in an enamel cast-iron
trough. This is the more rapid method, but its results are not so satisfactory
as in the cold process. The latter is effected with a bath of
double sulphate of nickel and ammonia, the articles to be nickelised
being suspended by a platinum wire attached to the positive pole of the
battery, while a plate of pure nickel, to restore the metal to the bath, is
put in connection with the negative pole. The nickelisation thus produced,
though it requires a longer time than the other process is finer
and more durable.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are, however, several objections to nickel-plating. The process
is injurious to the workmen engaged in it. The thin coating of nickel is
liable to peel off, and in the case of parts exposed to wear, or even with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>cleanings, in course of time, the nickel becomes so worn off at the edges
as to expose the base metal beneath. Besides, nickelisation does not entirely
prevent the oxidisation of steel and iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>A French Company, La Société Française Anonyme de Nickel, briefly
referred to in connection with the Applied Science Exhibition, Paris, are
endeavouring to supersede the nickelisation of brass and copper by the
use of solid nickel bronze, which is thus obtained. The ore, <i>garnierite</i>, extensive
deposits of which exist in New Caledonia, the French penal settlement,
is worked by Messrs. John Higginson and Co., of Noumea, the
<i>concessionaires</i>. It is by them subjected to a roasting on preliminary
fusion, which forms a regulus, containing from 60 to 70 per cent. of
metallic nickel. This substance is shipped to the works of the company
at Septemes, near Marseilles, where it is smelted into ingots and granule,
containing 99½ per cent, of pure nickel, and ¼ per cent, of utilisable metallic
substances. The extent of the mineral deposits in New Caledonia,
the reduction in the cost of freight owing to the concentration of metal
through the preliminary fusion, and the economy effected by the new
methods of reduction devised by M. Jules Garnier, enable the company
to sell the pure metal at about one-half the price it obtained three years
ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a long time past, efforts have been made to work nickel, but without
success, until the present year, because it was found too brittle;
now, however, pure nickel has been rolled and forged; cups, knives, and
other articles have been formed of it. As a rule, the pure nickel is formed
by the founder with various proportions of copper, zinc, and tin, according
to circumstance, to form nickel bronze; but at least 20 per cent. of
nickel is required to secure inoxidisability, and to give the desired tint.
All articles that are now made of brass or copper nickelised may be produced
in solid white nickel bronze, by the same processes, and with the
same plant, and at practically the same cost; they are also 20 per cent.
stronger, so that in many cases they may be made so much lighter. The
great strength and the property of non-oxidisation render this alloy
eminently suitable for mathematical and musical instruments. A small
quantity of nickel added to steel increases its hardness, and renders it
inoxidisable, while edge-tools made of the alloy stand better than those
of ordinary steel. A nickel bell metal is also found to give good results.
The Paris Exhibition of 1878 proved the action of a totally new system
of metallurgy in connection with this beautiful metal, and that of 1879
showed its practical introduction into most branches of manufacturing
industry.—<cite>Journal of the Society of Arts.</cite></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
